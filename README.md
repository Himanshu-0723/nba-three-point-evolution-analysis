# 🏀 The Three-Point Revolution: How the NBA Evolved (2001–2025)

A data-driven analysis of how offensive strategy, player roles, and team performance evolved during the modern three-point era.

# 📌 Project Overview

Over the last two decades, the NBA has undergone a dramatic strategic transformation.
This project analyzes league-wide trends from 2001 to 2025 to understand:

- How three-point usage evolved

- Whether efficiency changed alongside increased volume

- How player roles adapted

- Whether modern offensive strategies influence winning

- The goal is to move beyond basic trends and uncover structural changes in how basketball is played.

# ❓ Key Questions

- How has league-wide three-point attempt rate changed over time?

- Did shooting efficiency remain stable as volume increased?

- How have player usage and on-court impact evolved?

- Do three-point-heavy teams win more games?

- How has team strategy adoption shifted across seasons?

NBA team & player statistics (2001–2025)

# 📊 Dashboard Structure
## 📈 Page 1 – League-Wide Three-Point Evolution

### Analyzes:

- Year-over-year change in 3PT rate

- League-wide 3PT attempt share

- Shooting efficiency trends (FG% vs 3P%)

### 🔎 Key Insight

The NBA’s three-point attempt rate accelerated sharply after 2014, while overall shooting efficiency remained stable — confirming a sustainable structural shift rather than a temporary trend.

## 👤 Page 2 – Player Usage vs On-Court Impact

### Analyzes:

- Shot usage per minute vs impact per minute

- Player archetype distribution

- Role specialization trends

### 🔎 Key Insight

High offensive usage does not guarantee high impact. The modern NBA shows increasing role specialization, with efficient lower-usage contributors emerging alongside star drivers.

## 🏆 Page 3 – Team Strategy vs Winning Percentage

### Analyzes:

- Team-level three-point attempt rate vs win %

- Strategy classification (Balanced, Paint-Focused, Three-Point Heavy)

- Average win percentage by strategy type

### 🔎 Key Insight

Three-point-heavy teams consistently demonstrate the highest average winning percentage, suggesting modern perimeter-focused strategies drive competitive success.

## 📊 Page 4 – Evolution of Team Offensive Strategies

### Analyzes:

- League-wide adoption of offensive archetypes

- Strategic transition over time

### 🔎 Key Insight

Since 2014, the league has rapidly shifted away from paint-focused offenses toward three-point-heavy systems, confirming a structural and irreversible evolution in team philosophy.

## 🧠 Page 5 – Executive Summary

### Consolidated insights:

- Three-point volume more than doubled since 2001

- Major acceleration occurred post-2014

- Efficiency remained stable despite increased volume

- Role specialization intensified

- Modern perimeter strategies correlate with winning success
